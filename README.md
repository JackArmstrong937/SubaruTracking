This Website was designed and developed to be used as a means of more efficiently tracking customer vehicle service times and other Subaru Lube Technician-related statistics/performance.

      When first loading the website, the user is required to put in the correct login credentials in order to access the site. In this application, there are two users: a lube technician and an admin. The lube technician is the basic user who has restricted access to
      certain functions such as the Repair Order (RO) information submission form and permission to change and update technician data. The admin has full access to the website's features and functions.

  <h2>Navigation Tabs/Pages</h2>
    <img src="https://github.com/JackArmstrong937/SubaruTracking/assets/101604941/6e9d91d9-60b0-4336-97d3-267d1e86891d"/>
    <div> 
      Upon successful login, the user will be indexed to this main page which serves as the main overview of statistical data and location for the RO information submission form used by the admin. At the top right highlighted in red is the website navigation/pages.
      The Efficiencies tab directs back to the current page shown above, and the Entries tab directs to another page that provides a more detailed data set of RO entries and their respective lube technician details. The Techs tab shows all lube technician information such as name, tech 
      number, etc.
      On the Techs page, lube technician information can be changed/updated and new techs can be inputted. Next, the RO-Clock tab directs to a page that has a stopwatch used for tracking the time spent working on a vehicle. Finally, the logout tab simply logs the user out, redirects them 
      to the login page, and requires them to input the correct credentials to log back in.

  <h2>Overall Statistics of Lube Technician</h2>
    <img src="https://github.com/JackArmstrong937/SubaruTracking/assets/101604941/c991c80b-2456-4692-98c4-43ebebea8bf8"/>
    <div>
      The highlighted area is the main table that displays the overall combined statistical data of all lube technicians for that respective pay period.
    </div>


  The idea was for when a lube tech starts working on
      a car, they would start the timer after putting in the required information and then once the repairs were complete would stop and submit the created time stamp. Later, when the admin fills in the rest of the information for the specific RO, the lube technician RO-Clock
      timestamp would get added to that RO entry. The main purpose of this RO-Clock feature is the provide a more accurate timestamp for how long the repairs actually took as opposed to the overall vehicle service timestamp, which includes time working with the advisors, waiting for 
      approved parts, and working with the customer. Without this RO-Clock timestamp, the efficiencies aren't reflective of actual repair times.
